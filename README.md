Airline-Reservation-System
The main aim of the project was to develop a website which would facilitate the reservation of
online air tickets. Airline Reservation System contains the details about flight schedules and its fare
tariffs, passenger reservations and ticket records. It saves time as it allows online procedure as
users no longer to wait in a queue to book the flights. It is automatically generated by the server.
Admin is the main authority who can do addition, deletion, and modification of flights if required.
